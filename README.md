# Ultimate SD upscale with wd1.4 tagger

Majority of the code is borrowed from [ultimate sd upscale](https://github.com/Coyote-A/ultimate-upscale-for-automatic1111) and [wd1.4 tagger](https://github.com/toriato/stable-diffusion-webui-wd14-tagger)

Recommend using higher thresholds from 0.5-0.9 and denoise between 0.3-0.5 (can work at higher denoise but depends on image)
